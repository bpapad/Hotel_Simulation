# Hotel_Simulation
Simulates a hotel's daily runtime for a user-given daycount, randomly generating incoming clients and handling each generated reservation's check-in and check-out.

Java

The user inserts the number of days to simulate and the program randomly generates CLients and Reservations and, after checking for available Rooms, the first available Room is assigned to the Client. If no Room is available, the Client's Reservations gets turned down.
